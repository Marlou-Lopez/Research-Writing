(74, 14, 'Causation vs Correlation: How tell when someone\'s trying to feed you baloney ', 'Last time that somebody told you that what you were doing was bad, did they offer evidence - and did you believe it? \r\n\r\nIn an age obsessed with fake facts, hopefully you have an armour of skepticism forming already. But here\'s a chink in the armour you may not have thought of: perfectly true facts can also be warped to manipulate people. One of the most common ways to do this is by mixing up causation and correlation.\r\n\r\nCausation and correlation are both extremely boring statistical words that underlie very simple concepts. Two events are correlated if they happen at the same place, or at the same time. For example, in children, shoe size is most likely correlated with the number of books they have read â€“ older children have both read more books and have bigger feet. The two things do not cause each other but do happen at the same time. Causation, on the other hand, means that one of the two events is happening because of the other. For example, students who do better in exams also have a higher acceptance rate into college - because grades are one of the things that college considers when evaluating an applicant.\r\n\r\nIt can be very difficult to separate causation and correlation. When two events happen at the same time or in the same place, it is quite difficult to determine whether one of the two is causing the other, or whether they are independent but happening together. Truly independent events, in fact, can be correlated simply by chance through what is known as spurious correlation. For example, in the years between 2000 and 2009, the rate of divorce in the state of Maine was almost perfectly correlated with how much margarine people consumed, although of course buttery spreads have nothing to do with divorce.\r\n\r\nAlso, events can be linked by some causation, but not in a straightforward way. Two correlated events can both be caused by the same thing but be independent of each other. That\'s what happens as children get bigger feet and read more books - both are caused by a third factor, their age. Another great example of this type of causation is health supplements. While scientists have shown that most nutritional supplements don\'t actually improve your health, people who take them tend to exercise more and eat well, which results them in also being healthier. Their health improvement is actually caused by their attention to their health, even though it\'s correlated with their use of supplements.\r\n\r\nSome forms of oral contraception are correlated with a higher risk of cervical cancer - but they don\'t cause the cancer directly. This shows another way in which two correlated events can have a causal relationship, via a chain of cause-effect reactions. In this case, because women who take the pill often do not use any other form of contraception, they end up being more likely to contract a sexually-transmitted virus called HPV, which leads to increased cervical cancer risk. The best way for a woman to limit her cervical cancer risk is therefore to use barrier methods of contraception or to get an HPV vaccine and not, in fact, to stop taking the pill!\r\n\r\nSo how on earth can we differentiate causation and correlation when somebody is trying to sell us an idea? The best, most comprehensive thing to do is to find some authoritative sources on the subject and read around it. For example, the anti-vaccine movement maintains that vaccination leads to autism. It is very easy to find innumerable resources pointing at the fact that the scientific community is completely unanimous in agreeing that vaccines are perfectly safe. It\'s just that the age at which most children are diagnosed with autism is around the same age when they receive most of their shots. The two events are simply happening at the same time, even though they are just as related as margarine and divorces in New England. If you don\'t have time to do the digging, or if your digging is inconclusive, a good technique is to play devil\'s advocate. Is there any other way that these events could be related other than by a direct cause-and-effect reaction? \r\n\r\nFor instance, many people will tell you that couples who choose to live together before they are married have a 30% higher chance of divorce than those who wait. This is often brought forward as incontrovertible evidence that cohabitation causes divorce. However, it is very easy to think of other reasons for the link. People who live together before they marry, for example, are less likely to be religious than those who do not. Religious people tend to have much harsher views on divorce than their secular peers, and are likely to stay married when others would perhaps separate.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility is that people who live together may end up marrying because of pressure from their families, which means they commit to a partner they had not initially selected as a potential spouse. In this case, cohabitation causes forced marriage, which causes divorce. In other words, there are many reasonable ways in which divorce and pre-marital cohabitation can be related other than direct cause-effect. So next time you someone who quotes a shaky correlation at you, remember to ask about causation. Unless they can tell you how the correlation is caused, you\'d be better off not letting them worry you.\r\n', '[\"causation\",\"correlation\"]', 2, '{\"keys\":[\"causation\",\"correlation\",\"tell\",\"trying\",\"feed\",\"baloney\",\"time\",\"somebody\",\"told\",\"doing\",\"offer\",\"believe\",\"obses\",\"fake\",\"fact\",\"hope\",\"armour\",\"skepticism\",\"forming\",\"chink\",\"thought\",\"perfect\",\"true\",\"warp\",\"people\",\"common\",\"way\",\"mixing\",\"extreme\",\"boring\",\"statistical\",\"word\",\"underlie\",\"concept\",\"event\",\"correlate\",\"happen\",\"straightforward\",\"children\",\"shoe\",\"size\",\"likely\",\"number\",\"book\",\"older\",\"bigger\",\"feet\",\"thing\",\"hand\",\"happening\",\"student\",\"better\",\"exam\",\"higher\",\"acceptance\",\"college\",\"evaluating\",\"applicant\",\"quite\",\"determine\",\"independent\",\"truly\",\"simply\",\"known\",\"spuriou\",\"year\",\"divorce\",\"maine\",\"margarine\",\"consume\",\"course\",\"buttery\",\"spread\",\"link\",\"factor\",\"great\",\"health\",\"supplement\",\"scientist\",\"shown\",\"nutritional\",\"tend\",\"result\",\"improvement\",\"attention\",\"oral\",\"contraception\",\"cervical\",\"cancer\",\"causal\",\"relationship\",\"chain\",\"reaction\",\"women\",\"pill\",\"contract\",\"sexual\",\"transmit\",\"viru\",\"cal\",\"increase\",\"woman\",\"limit\",\"barrier\",\"method\",\"vaccine\",\"stop\",\"taking\",\"earth\",\"sell\",\"comprehensive\",\"authoritative\",\"source\",\"anti\",\"maintain\",\"vaccination\",\"autism\",\"innumerability\",\"resource\",\"pointing\",\"scientific\",\"community\",\"unanimou\",\"agreeing\",\"diagnose\",\"receive\",\"shot\",\"england\",\"digging\",\"inconclusive\",\"technique\",\"play\",\"devil\",\"advocate\",\"couple\",\"choose\",\"marry\",\"wait\",\"brought\",\"forward\",\"incontrovertibility\",\"cohabitation\",\"religiou\",\"harsher\",\"secular\",\"peer\",\"possibility\",\"marrying\",\"pressure\",\"family\",\"partner\",\"initial\",\"forc\",\"marriage\",\"reasonability\",\"marital\",\"quote\",\"shaky\",\"un\",\"letting\",\"worry\"],\"no_of_keys\":161}', '2019-02-06 05:19:19'),
(75, 14, 'What Does It Mean To Say That A Person With Autism Has An Extreme Male Brain?', 'This article is about whether the concept of an â€˜extreme male brainâ€™ has any explanatory power for autism. Clinical autism is more common in men than women, and amongst people who do not have a diagnosis of autism, men score somewhat higher than women, on average, on questionnaires which assess behaviors that are common in people with autism. These questionnaires score interests in how things work, known as â€˜systemizingâ€™ as â€˜maleâ€™ and interests in other peopleâ€™s emotions and thoughts, known as â€˜empathizingâ€™ as â€˜female.â€™ This has led to the view, proposed Simon Baron-Cohen and his colleagues, that people with autism have an â€˜extreme male brainâ€™ (1). But what does it mean to say that a brain is â€˜extremely maleâ€™?\r\n\r\nMen and women differ, on average, in many aspects of anatomy, physiology, and behavior, but these differences do not necessarily vary together. On average, men have bigger feet than women, and, on average, men are more interested in trains than are women. But men with big feet are probably no more interested in trains than are men with small feet, so, which is the more â€˜extreme male,â€™ the man with big feet or the man who likes trains?\r\n\r\nMost of the things that differ between men and women consist of externally definable measures. For example, on average, men have more muscle strength than women where muscle strength can be measured experimentally. But â€˜being maleâ€™ is internally defined â€“ it can only be measured against what males are actually like. Being an â€˜extreme maleâ€™ can only mean being an â€˜extremely normal male,â€™ not being an â€˜extremely unusual male.â€™ Most crimes of violence are committed by men rather than women, but that does not mean that a violent man is â€˜manly.â€™\r\n\r\nOn the Baron-Cohen Autism Questionnaire (AQ), which has scores from 0â€“50 and on which high scores are regarded as indicative of autistic-like behavior, men from the general population scored ~18 and women scored ~15, a difference of 3 points. Men with autism scored ~36 and women with autism scored ~39, again a difference of 3 points (2). But the difference between people with autism and people from the general population was ~18 points. People with autism resemble each other but differ substantially from other people. A woman with autism is not like a man; she is like other people with autism. Autism is a clinical condition; being male is not.\r\n\r\nAs scientists, we no longer believe, as did the philosopher Descartes, that the mind is some kind of immaterial substance that inhabits the body, including the brain. Rather, we accept that the mind is â€˜embodiedâ€™ in the brain, that is to say, that the brain is active when we move or think or perceive the outside world. â€˜Meâ€™ and â€˜my brainâ€™ are not two separate things; they are two aspects of the same thing. So, in a â€˜softâ€™ sense, if I behave in a male-typical way, then my brain must be acting in a male-typical way. If I behave in an autistic way, then my brain must be acting in an autistic way. But science is about explanation, and the â€˜extreme male brain theoryâ€™ of autism is making the â€˜hardâ€™ claim that there is something specifically male about the structure of the brains of people with autism. Scientific research could investigate this, but what would it mean to say that a brain is â€˜male,â€™ let alone â€˜extremely male,â€™ when it occurs in a woman with autism? To describe a woman with autism as having â€˜an extreme male brainâ€™ is logically equivalent to describing a very tall woman as having â€˜extreme male heightâ€™ because, on average, men are taller than women. However tall she is, she is just a very tall woman. Neither description has any explanatory power.\r\n\r\nIn most people, there is no discrepancy between the various ways in which they are male or female. The presence of a Y chromosome, appropriate levels of male hormones, male genitalia, and male secondary sexual characteristics (for example, a deep voice), male-typical interests and behavior, and a sense of male identity all occur together in a typical male. The equivalent female characteristics all occur together in a typical female. But genetic, hormonal, and anatomical anomalies can occasionally occur in different individuals, and it is then a problem to privilege one factor over another in order to ascribe a sex to a person. Furthermore, interests, behaviors and a sense of gender identity vary widely from one person to another. This is just human diversity. So for the â€˜extreme male brain theoryâ€™ to have any explanatory power in understanding autism, there must be something biologically different about the brains of people with autism compared to the brains of people who are not autistic. Some researchers are indeed looking at ways in which the brains of people with autism differ from those who do not have autism, but to argue that the brains of such people must be different because they have high AQ scores (which is true in the â€˜softâ€™ sense) while also arguing that such a brain anomaly â€˜explainsâ€™ the high AQ score is circular and, therefore, unhelpful.\r\n\r\nWe know from the AQ questionnaire that people with autism usually have high AQ scores. But can the AQ be used to help detect people with autism? This is a subtly different question. In a study which looked at the scores of people who already had some sort of mental health difficulty, AQ scores did not distinguish between people who were subsequently given a diagnosis of autism and those who were given a different mental health diagnosis, particularly â€˜generalized anxiety disorderâ€™ (3). Some people who were found to have autism did not score highly on the AQ, and, indeed, people who were given a diagnosis of autism but who did not also have a generalized anxiety disorder were particularly likely not have high scores on the AQ. So high AQ scores may not be specific to autism when compared to other mental health difficulties and so do not help to provide a differential diagnosis.\r\n\r\nAt present, there are no aspects of brain structure, or physiological or hormonal effects, which are diagnostic of autism and which can be related to brain differences between men and women. The brain is like other parts of the body in showing certain average differences in size and shape between men and women but all these brain differences show some overlap between men and women such that no brain structures are found only in men or only in women (4). Considerable effort has been made to investigate whether exposure to sex hormones before birth can produce autistic symptoms after birth. But while prenatal exposure to hormones affects brain development and abnormal exposure can result in abnormal development, these effects have not been found to be specific to autism since further developmental abnormalities may also occur.\r\n\r\nThe idea that there is such a thing as an extreme male brain is an example of â€˜Essentialism,â€™ which is the philosophical idea that things have a set of characteristics that make them what they are. An essentialist would argue that there is such a thing as â€˜maleness,â€™ with the implication that men deviating from this maleness are not truly male, rather than that variation between men merely makes maleness more diverse. But being male, like being female, involves no more and no less than being everything that males or females are. Many people are still stereotypical in their way of thinking, but in recent times we have developed a greater awareness of the complexity of sex and gender and are moving away from this essentialist thinking.', '[\"person\",\"autism\",\"male\",\"brain\"]', 2, '{\"keys\":[\"doe\",\"mean\",\"person\",\"autism\",\"extreme\",\"male\",\"brain\",\"article\",\"concept\",\"explanatory\",\"power\",\"clinical\",\"women\",\"people\",\"diagnosi\",\"score\",\"somewhat\",\"higher\",\"questionnaire\",\"assess\",\"behavior\",\"interest\",\"thing\",\"work\",\"known\",\"systemizing\",\"emotion\",\"thought\",\"empathizing\",\"female\",\"propose\",\"simon\",\"cohen\",\"colleague\",\"differ\",\"anatomy\",\"physiology\",\"difference\",\"necessary\",\"vary\",\"bigger\",\"feet\",\"train\",\"probab\",\"like\",\"consist\",\"external\",\"definability\",\"example\",\"muscle\",\"strength\",\"experimental\",\"internal\",\"define\",\"actual\",\"unusual\",\"crime\",\"violence\",\"commit\",\"violent\",\"secondary\",\"indicative\",\"autistic\",\"population\",\"point\",\"resemble\",\"substantial\",\"woman\",\"scientist\",\"longer\",\"philosopher\",\"descarte\",\"kind\",\"immaterial\",\"substance\",\"body\",\"including\",\"accept\",\"embody\",\"active\",\"perceive\",\"world\",\"behave\",\"acting\",\"science\",\"explanation\",\"theory\",\"making\",\"hard\",\"claim\",\"specifical\",\"structure\",\"scientific\",\"research\",\"investigate\",\"occur\",\"having\",\"logical\",\"describing\",\"tall\",\"height\",\"taller\",\"just\",\"description\",\"discrepancy\",\"variou\",\"way\",\"presence\",\"chromosome\",\"appropriate\",\"hormone\",\"genitalia\",\"sexual\",\"deep\",\"identity\",\"genetic\",\"hormonal\",\"anatomical\",\"anomaly\",\"occasional\",\"problem\",\"privilege\",\"factor\",\"order\",\"ascribe\",\"furthermore\",\"gender\",\"widely\",\"diversity\",\"understanding\",\"biological\",\"compare\",\"researcher\",\"looking\",\"argue\",\"arguing\",\"anoma\",\"explain\",\"circular\",\"unhelp\",\"know\",\"used\",\"help\",\"detect\",\"subtly\",\"question\",\"looke\",\"mental\",\"health\",\"difficulty\",\"subsequent\",\"given\",\"particular\",\"generalize\",\"anxiety\",\"disorder\",\"highly\",\"likely\",\"provide\",\"differential\",\"present\",\"physiological\",\"effect\",\"relate\",\"showing\",\"certain\",\"size\",\"overlap\",\"considerability\",\"effort\",\"exposure\",\"birth\",\"symptom\",\"prenatal\",\"development\",\"abnormal\",\"developmental\",\"abnormality\",\"essentialism\",\"philosophical\",\"essentialist\",\"maleness\",\"implication\",\"deviating\",\"truly\",\"variation\",\"stereotypical\",\"recent\",\"time\",\"develope\",\"greater\",\"awareness\",\"complexity\"],\"no_of_keys\":193}', '2019-02-06 05:21:56'),
(76, 14, 'New Device Can Desalinate Seawater', 'Letâ€™s face it: Access to clean water is something we take for granted. At this very moment, chances are youâ€™re no more than a 30-second walk from a faucet. Itâ€™s not all that easy for everybody, though.\r\n\r\nScientists estimate that about 4 billion people â€” 66 percent of the worldâ€™s population â€” donâ€™t have access to fresh water for at least one month out of a year. Water scarcity occurs when the rate itâ€™s used by is twice as much as whatâ€™s available. This is most common in areas with irrigated fields or little natural potable water.\r\n\r\nFactors like climate change and population density also play a large part in availability. With an increasing amount of water shortages at home and abroad, itâ€™s time we explored new methods of making whatâ€™s available safer to drink. One of the methods is to desalinate seawater.\r\nDesalination Demystified\r\n\r\nDesalination, the process of removing salt from saltwater, sounds simple. However, itâ€™s much more complicated in practice. Making saltwater drinkable requires a huge amount of energy â€” typically from fossil fuels â€” and often leaves behind environmentally damaging waste.\r\n\r\nThe plants themselves must also comply with various environmental protection standards. Though theyâ€™re in place for good reason, the increased costs could drive up already high water prices in stricken areas.\r\n\r\nThanks to recent advances in desalination techniques, this could all be set to change.\r\n\r\ngalaxy-multi-color\r\nWhat Will Scientists Discover Next?\r\nScience news delivered weekly!\r\nPrivacy Policy\r\n\r\nGraphene Membranes\r\n\r\nA research team at the University of Manchester recently reported that theyâ€™ve discovered a far more useful method of desalination using complex graphene-oxide membranes. This project builds upon previous research employing the membranes to filter out nanoparticles and organic molecules. At that time, the filters did not have any way of removing the common salts encountered in seawater.\r\n\r\nThe problem was, when exposed to water, the membrane would swell, allowing small salts to bypass the filter. Through research and testing, the team developed a way to prevent the swelling and control the pore size, allowing for better filtration.\r\nScience at Work to Desalinate Seawater\r\n\r\nThe membranes work by blocking salt on a microscopic level. When salt dissolves in water, water molecules form a sort of shell around the salt molecules. The pores of the membrane are so small that they allow the water molecules through without the larger salt molecules. This process blocks 97 percent of the salt from flowing through.\r\n\r\nAccording to joint-authors Jijo Abraham and Dr. Vasu Siddeswara Kalangi, the ability to control the pore size of the membrane opens up the technology to many other applications than just desalination. Scientists could, for example, filter ions by size.\r\nHope for the Future\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the graphene-oxide filter is that itâ€™s comparatively simple to make in a lab, especially compared with a graphene lattice, which is hard to produce in significant quantities and must have the holes drilled into it.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate the swelling, the team used the deviously simple solution of sandwiching the filter between two walls made of common epoxy. This restriction is what allows people to fine-tune what passes through the filter.\r\n\r\nThanks to the cost-effectiveness of this filter, areas with few economic resources could start producing fresh water at a fraction of the cost of a desalination plant. As the UN estimates water scarcity will only increase in urban areas and developing countries, the sooner this technology is perfected, the better.\r\n\r\nThough it still needs refining in terms of durability and ease of cleaning, the development team is hopeful their research will play a part in mitigating our impending water crisis.', '[\"device\",\"desalinate\",\"seawater\"]', 2, '{\"keys\":[\"device\",\"desalinate\",\"seawater\",\"face\",\"access\",\"clean\",\"water\",\"grant\",\"moment\",\"chance\",\"walk\",\"faucet\",\"easy\",\"everybody\",\"scientist\",\"estimate\",\"billion\",\"people\",\"percent\",\"world\",\"population\",\"month\",\"year\",\"scarcity\",\"occur\",\"rate\",\"used\",\"twice\",\"availability\",\"area\",\"microscopic\",\"natural\",\"potability\",\"factor\",\"like\",\"climate\",\"change\",\"density\",\"play\",\"huge\",\"increasing\",\"shortage\",\"abroad\",\"time\",\"explore\",\"method\",\"making\",\"safer\",\"drink\",\"desalination\",\"demystify\",\"removing\",\"salt\",\"complicate\",\"practice\",\"drinkability\",\"require\",\"energy\",\"typical\",\"fossil\",\"fuel\",\"environmental\",\"damaging\",\"waste\",\"plant\",\"comply\",\"variou\",\"protection\",\"reason\",\"increase\",\"cost\",\"drive\",\"high\",\"stricken\",\"thank\",\"advance\",\"technique\",\"galaxy\",\"multi\",\"color\",\"discover\",\"science\",\"delivere\",\"weekly\",\"privacy\",\"policy\",\"graphene\",\"membrane\",\"team\",\"university\",\"manchester\",\"report\",\"discovere\",\"using\",\"complex\",\"oxide\",\"project\",\"build\",\"previou\",\"employing\",\"filter\",\"nanoparticle\",\"molecule\",\"encountere\",\"problem\",\"allowing\",\"bypass\",\"testing\",\"develope\",\"prevent\",\"swelling\",\"control\",\"pore\",\"size\",\"better\",\"filtration\",\"blocking\",\"level\",\"dissolve\",\"shell\",\"larger\",\"flowing\",\"according\",\"joint\",\"author\",\"jijo\",\"abraham\",\"vasu\",\"siddeswara\",\"kalangi\",\"ability\",\"open\",\"technology\",\"application\",\"example\",\"ion\",\"hope\",\"future\",\"beauty\",\"comparative\",\"especial\",\"compare\",\"lattice\",\"hard\",\"quantity\",\"hole\",\"dril\",\"mitigate\",\"devious\",\"solution\",\"sandwiching\",\"wall\",\"epoxy\",\"restriction\",\"tune\",\"effectiveness\",\"economic\",\"resource\",\"start\",\"producing\",\"fraction\",\"urban\",\"developing\",\"sooner\",\"refining\",\"term\",\"durability\",\"ease\",\"cleaning\",\"mitigating\",\"impending\",\"crisi\"],\"no_of_keys\":172}', '2019-02-06 05:24:05'),
(77, 14, 'Does Intermittent Fasting Work?', 'One of the biggest diet and nutrition trends these days is intermittent fasting. Every week, I hear from listeners wanting to know my thoughts on it. I\'ve mentioned intermittent fasting on the podcast before, in an episode on the health benefits of fasting. But that was way back in 2011. At that point, the research was still quite preliminary and most of it had been done in rodents. Nonetheless, researchers were excited about the potential for intermittent fasting to prevent or reverse diabetes, weight gain, DNA damage, and other artifacts of aging.\r\n\r\nBased on these promising but preliminary results, lots of people started experimenting with various forms of modified or intermittent fastingâ€”generating a lot of positive anecdotal reports. Over the last few years, more studies have been doneâ€”some of them on actual humans.\r\nAdvertisement\r\nHow Does Intermittent Fasting Work?\r\n\r\nBefore I dip into the latest research, let me define some terms. Intermittent fasting is an umbrella term that includes a pretty wide variety of approaches, most of which fall into one of two categories: alternate day fasting and restricted eating windows.\r\nAlternate Day Fasting\r\n\r\nAlternate day fasting involves switching back and forth between days when you eat more and days when you eat less. In some versions, you eat nothing or next to nothing on your fast days and as much as you want on your feast days. Other versions have you cut your usual food intake by a third to a half on your fast days and allow you to eat more than your usual food intake on your feast days. (This is sometimes described as calorie cycling.)\r\n\r\nThe proportion of fast to feast days also varies. Some protocols have you fasting every other day. Another popular variation is the 5:2 diet, where you fast for two non-consecutive days every week.\r\nRestricted Eating Window\r\n\r\nThe other approach thatâ€™s commonly included in discussions of intermittent fasting is the restricted eating window. I talked about this in my episode on timing your meals. Instead of restricting your food intake, you restrict your meal schedule. \r\n\r\nAgain, there are lots of variations on this approach. Some people follow a four-hour eating window, essentially eating just one meal a day. Others might eat two or three meals within an eight or ten hour window. (If youâ€™re a breakfast skipper, you might already be doing this without even realizing it!)  \r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\nThe timing of the window is also up for debate. Because of our circadian rhythms, it might work better to put your eating window in the first half of the day. But due to our social rhythms, most people who follow this approach prefer to have their eating window in the second half of the day.', '[\"fasting\",\"work\",\"diet\",\"nutrition\"]', 2, '{\"keys\":[\"doe\",\"intermittent\",\"fasting\",\"work\",\"biggest\",\"diet\",\"nutrition\",\"trend\",\"day\",\"week\",\"hear\",\"listener\",\"wanting\",\"know\",\"thought\",\"mentione\",\"podcast\",\"episode\",\"health\",\"benefit\",\"point\",\"research\",\"quite\",\"preliminary\",\"rodent\",\"nonethe\",\"researcher\",\"excite\",\"potential\",\"prevent\",\"reverse\",\"diabete\",\"weight\",\"damage\",\"artifact\",\"aging\",\"based\",\"promising\",\"result\",\"lot\",\"people\",\"start\",\"experimenting\",\"variou\",\"form\",\"modify\",\"generating\",\"positive\",\"anecdotal\",\"year\",\"actual\",\"human\",\"advertisement\",\"latest\",\"define\",\"term\",\"umbrella\",\"include\",\"pretty\",\"wide\",\"approache\",\"fall\",\"category\",\"alternate\",\"restrict\",\"eating\",\"window\",\"involve\",\"switching\",\"forth\",\"version\",\"want\",\"feast\",\"usual\",\"food\",\"intake\",\"half\",\"allow\",\"calorie\",\"cycling\",\"proportion\",\"vary\",\"protocol\",\"consecutive\",\"approach\",\"discussion\",\"talk\",\"timing\",\"meal\",\"instead\",\"restricting\",\"schedule\",\"hour\",\"essential\",\"just\",\"breakfast\",\"skipper\",\"doing\",\"realizing\",\"debate\",\"circadian\",\"rhythm\",\"better\",\"social\",\"prefer\",\"second\"],\"no_of_keys\":106}', '2019-02-06 05:26:52'),
(78, 14, 'Why I donâ€™t bite everyone that stresses me out: The cost-benefit analysis of predators', 'There is controversy whenever a human creates a close interaction with a wild animal.  Those arguing in favour of the humanâ€™s behavior inevitably settle on the argument that if the animal didnâ€™t like it, the animal would have bit them or exhibited some sudden reaction to the human.  People who propose this argument have a very limited understanding of animal behavior.\r\n\r\nReal talk, I used to believe this totally incorrect argument, and I will never forget the day that changed my perspective forever.  I was a budding zoologist working on a remote island with a group of scientists that were ringing cormorants.  The cormorants squawked for awhile, but then got â€œusedâ€ to our presence and calmed down.  I was reassured that we werenâ€™t causing them any distress as we worked nearby, otherwise I expected that they would have shown it by either continuing to squawk or simply fly away.  Then, I noticed a few dead cormorants near where we worked.  I thought that they must have died before we arrived.  However, the senior researcher explained that they had been alive moments before but most likely died due to the stress of our presence.  That was an extremely powerful lesson in my young career and it challenged what I thought I â€œunderstoodâ€ about human interactions with animals.  Keep in mind, I was known for being an animal whisperer of sorts in my youth (see below) and truly believed that my special calm and confident nature could be detected by animals, and that they would accept my presence more readily than those who didnâ€™t have my nature.  That FernGully perspective is wrong and egocentric.  There are few scenarios where our presence isnâ€™t horribly stressful and disruptive to wild animals.   \r\nSquirrel demonstrating a cost/benefit analysis = the benefit of free food is higher than the stress my tie-dyed presence is causing.\r\n\r\nLarge predators are no exception.  They are just as vulnerable to our stress as cormorants and just as unlikely to express it externally, because the cost of those behaviors is expensive.  Predators have severe energetic constraints and are constantly calculating whether their actions are worth sacrificing energy for, this is a cost/benefit analysis.  We do similar analyses all the time.  For example, I have a Trader Joeâ€™s that is ~30 minutes from my home.  The food there is delicious and less expensive than my local grocery store.  However, I donâ€™t go to The Joe every time I am hungry.  Even though I would save money on discount blue cheese dip there, I would spend more money in fuel for my car â€“ meaning the entire trip would cost me more in the long run.  The costs of this behavior is too high and not worth it.\r\n\r\nWhite sharks are especially discerning since they can burn a lot of energy quickly and are unlikely to encounter large meals in the open ocean to refuel.  So they make conservative decisions that prioritize maintaining energy stores (especially during gestation when a large portion of their energy budget is developing shark embryos).  In the recent case of large white sharks scavenging from a sperm whale in Hawaii, there were several divers in the water creating close interactions with the sharks for social media purposes.  Controversy ensued and the idea that the white sharks must have â€œenjoyedâ€ these interactions otherwise they would have swam away or bit the divers has been presented.  But it is not supported.  First, white sharks full of whale blubber are experiencing some pretty hardcore torpor.  Also, blubber is very positivity buoyant, meaning a stomach full of blubber is essentially the same as if we ate a ton of foam and then tried to swim about.  White sharks at whale carcasses are typically slow-moving with low aggression, even towards each other.  Itâ€™s not that whale blubber makes them â€œhappy,â€ itâ€™s that being aggressive and swimming fast when there are going to be many other white sharks around AND youâ€™re going to have a stomach full of floaty blubber is energetically expensive and the costs of these behaviors are too high.\r\nFigure 4 from Fallows, C., Gallagher, A. J., & Hammerschlag, N. (2013). White sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) scavenging on whales and its potential role in further shaping the ecology of an apex predator. PLoS One, 8(4), e60797.\r\n\r\nDoes that mean diving with full-bellied white sharks is safe?  Absolutely not â€“ for them or for you.  It doesnâ€™t matter how well you think you â€œknowâ€ a predator â€“ species or individual â€“ they are still dangerous.  We all know the list of fatal tragedies that start off with well-known humans believing that they have enough experience to take big risks, and each of those fatalities ends with the animal suffering, too.  For the sharks, disrupting a rare feeding event has long-term implications.  The stress caused â€“ whether they exhibit that stress externally or not â€“ is burning their limited energy, forcing them to recalculate their future behaviours until (if?) they encounter the next windfall.  Also â€“ although currently undocumented â€“ itâ€™s a common thought amongst shark researchers that mating could occur at large feeding events like whale carcasses since itâ€™s provides male sharks an opportunity to take advantage of the large femaleâ€™s torpor to attempt mating approaches (I personally believe the same is true at seal colonies).  Boats and divers disrupt these behaviours.\r\n\r\nI donâ€™t bite every person that causes me stress.  I donâ€™t full-sprint away from every situation that causes me stress.  That doesnâ€™t mean that I am not experiencing stress that impacts my behavior and health.  The same is true for every one of these close animal interactions created by humans.

(79, 14, 'Protesters Object to Display of Looted Objects at Israelâ€™s Bible Lands Museum', 'On Wednesday, January 30, a small group of Israeli human rights activists gathered outside the Bible Lands Museum in Jerusalem to protest the display of looted archaeological artifacts from occupied Palestinian territories in a controversial new exhibition.\r\n\r\nFinds Gone Astray, which opened on December 30, features 40,000 artifacts that the Archaeology Department of the Civil Administration (ADCA) â€” Israelâ€™s military government in the West Bank â€” confiscated from looters and unauthorized dealers in antiquities over the past 50 years. The items were stolen from sites in occupied Palestinian territories, Syria, and Iraq. The protestors demand the immediate removal of the exhibition and the repatriation of the stolen items to the Palestinian Authority.\r\n\r\nA statement released by the Bible Lands Museum says, â€œFinds Gone Astray is a unique opportunity to shed light on the importance of preserving the history of our region and protecting our ancient sites.â€ The Israeli mainstream press lauded the exhibition for displaying the â€œpreservedâ€ items, but in January, Michael Press reported a number of ethical and legal problems that cast heavy doubts over the exhibitionâ€™s legitimacy. Among those are clear violations of the 1954 Hague Convention for protecting cultural property in armed conflicts, a treaty that Israel joined in 1965, and the conventionâ€™s First Protocol, which prohibits the transfer of artifacts out of an occupied territory.\r\n\r\nâ€œA thief that steals from a thief is still a thief. He has to return the stolen goods and is not exempt from punishment,â€ Tsilli Goldenberg, one of the organizers of the protest, said in a conversation with Hyperallergic. Goldenberg, along with a handful of protestors, carried their banners at the entrance to the museum on a particularly cold Jerusalem evening, and were largely ignored by guests who arrived to attend a lecture on â€œKabala and the Evil Eye.â€\r\n\r\nThis exhibition, as Goldenberg points out, is an unprecedented occurrence at an Israeli museum, She said, â€œThe IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has been stealing archaeological items from the Occupied Territories for years, but this is the first time they are exhibiting them outside the Occupied Territories in West Jerusalem where most Palestinians are denied entry.â€\r\n\r\nGoldenberg refers to a long history of unauthorized archaeological excavations and illegal trade in antiquities in Israel. Some of the lootings were carried out by high ranking Israeli officials, most famously Israelâ€™s former Chief of Staff and Defense Minister Moshe Dayan. In 2015, Haaretz Newspaper revealed that Dayan used his government positions to order the digging of sites using IDF equipment and manpower and traded in the artifacts for personal gain. Dayanâ€™s illegal trade in antiquities has been known to the public in Israel since the 1970s, but authorities have turned a blind eye to his growing collection of stolen artifacts.\r\n\r\nA closer look at Dayanâ€™s story provides evidence that other museums in Israel are guilty of displaying looted artifacts from the Palestinian Territories. In 1986, five years after Dayanâ€™s death, his wife Rachel sold their collection to the Israel Museum for $1 million. After facing backlash from archaeologists, the Israel Museum defended the acquisition by claiming that the collectionâ€™s purchase by private donors for a discount price prevented it from being sold to collectors outside Israel â€œwho would have paid double for it.â€ This argument was later proven false when 165 items originally from Dayanâ€™s collection were auctioned at the Thomaston Place Auction Galleries in Maine in 2007. The items belonged to the collection of Irving Bernstein, a former leader of the United Jewish Appeal and personal friend of Dayan. Bernsteinâ€™s heirs, who put the artifacts on sale, said that Dayan had â€œgifted or soldâ€ the items to their father in the years prior to 1970. The family kept the rarest items to themselves (an additional 35 pieces,) while the rest were sold at bargain prices: a tenth-century BC redware male figure was sold for just $7,150, while a 50-inch tall terracotta amphora from 300 BC sold for $7,700. The top seven buyers received an autographed copy of Moshe Dayanâ€™s 1978 book Living with The Bible, which describes his â€œarchaeological pursuitsâ€ in Israel.\r\n\r\nItai Mack, a Human Rights lawyer and one of the organizers of the protest, wrote in a press release published on the leftist website Gush Shalom that beyond violating International Law, ADCAâ€™s collaboration with Bible Lands Museum on this exhibition is â€œpart of Israelâ€™s attempts to advance its De Facto annexation of the West Bank and normalize its occupation of the Palestinian Territories.â€ An exhibition of this kind, he added, should only be shown in the West Bank, where it would be accessible to all Palestinians. â€œThe archaeological finds must be returned to the Palestinian People, to whom they belong,â€ Goldenberg added.\r\n\r\nSo far, Mack and Goldenbergâ€™s outcry has gained no attention from the Israeli press, and the museum shows no signs of reconfiguring the exhibition. In a response sent to Hyperallergic, the museum wrote:\r\n\r\n    One of the most important tasks of a museum in our age is to preserve and protect the cultural heritage with which we are honored to present. The exhibition Finds Gone Astray is an unusual opportunity to bring to light artifacts that have never been made available to the public before. The Bible Lands Museum Jerusalem operates in accordance with the laws of the State of Israel and complies with the international conventions for preservation and protection of cultural heritage adopted by UNESCO. These artifacts are on temporary loan and will be returned to their previous storage facilities when the exhibition closes in May. We can only hope that they will once again be put on display in future exhibitions where students, scholars and the general public will be welcomed to appreciate, learn from and enjoy them.', '[\"israel\",\"museum\",\"land\",\"exhibition\",\"item\"]', 5, '{\"keys\":[\"israel\",\"museum\",\"land\",\"exhibition\",\"item\",\"dayan\",\"palestinian\",\"territory\",\"bible\",\"right\",\"find\",\"site\",\"release\",\"goldenberg\",\"collection\",\"sold\",\"artifact\",\"display\",\"israeli\",\"outside\",\"archaeological\",\"occupy\",\"gone\",\"history\",\"heavy\",\"jerusalem\",\"west\",\"stolen\",\"press\",\"loote\",\"protest\",\"astray\",\"bank\",\"antiquity\",\"light\",\"protecting\",\"convention\",\"cultural\",\"thief\",\"return\",\"said\",\"trade\",\"additional\",\"object\",\"january\",\"adca\",\"government\",\"unauthorize\",\"protestor\",\"immediate\",\"authority\",\"statement\",\"unique\",\"shed\",\"preserving\",\"displaying\",\"steal\",\"organizer\",\"hyperallergic\",\"carry\",\"entrance\",\"ignore\",\"attend\",\"defense\",\"excavation\",\"illegal\",\"famous\",\"moshe\",\"gain\",\"price\",\"later\",\"belong\",\"bernstein\",\"gift\",\"mack\",\"wrote\",\"accessibility\",\"heritage\",\"personal\",\"opportunity\",\"long\",\"student\",\"protester\",\"wednesday\",\"small\",\"activist\",\"gathere\",\"controversial\",\"opene\",\"december\",\"feature\",\"archaeology\",\"department\",\"civil\",\"administration\",\"military\",\"confiscate\",\"looter\",\"dealer\",\"syria\",\"iraq\",\"demand\",\"removal\",\"repatriation\",\"importance\",\"region\",\"mainstream\",\"laude\",\"preserv\",\"michael\",\"legal\",\"doubt\",\"legitimacy\",\"violation\",\"hague\",\"armed\",\"conflict\",\"treaty\",\"joine\",\"prohibit\",\"transfer\",\"exempt\",\"punishment\",\"tsilli\",\"conversation\",\"banner\",\"cold\",\"evening\",\"guest\",\"lecture\",\"kabala\",\"evil\",\"unprecedent\",\"occurrence\",\"force\",\"stealing\",\"exhibiting\",\"deny\",\"refer\",\"looting\",\"ranking\",\"official\",\"chief\",\"staff\",\"minister\",\"haaretz\",\"newspaper\",\"reveale\",\"equipment\",\"manpower\",\"blind\",\"growing\",\"closer\",\"guilty\",\"death\",\"wife\",\"rachel\",\"million\",\"facing\",\"backlash\",\"archaeologist\",\"defend\",\"acquisition\",\"claiming\",\"purchase\",\"donor\",\"collector\",\"paid\",\"proven\",\"false\",\"original\",\"auctione\",\"thomaston\",\"auction\",\"gallery\",\"irving\",\"leader\",\"unite\",\"jewish\",\"friend\",\"heir\",\"sale\",\"father\",\"prior\",\"kept\",\"rarest\",\"piece\",\"rest\",\"tenth\",\"century\",\"redware\",\"inch\",\"terracotta\",\"amphora\",\"seven\",\"buyer\",\"autograph\",\"copy\",\"living\",\"pursuit\",\"itai\",\"lawyer\",\"leftist\",\"website\",\"gush\",\"shalom\",\"violating\",\"collaboration\",\"attempt\",\"facto\",\"annexation\",\"normalize\",\"occupation\",\"outcry\",\"gaine\",\"sign\",\"reconfiguring\",\"response\",\"sent\",\"task\",\"preserve\",\"protect\",\"honore\",\"operate\",\"accordance\",\"law\",\"adopt\",\"unesco\",\"temporary\",\"loan\",\"storage\",\"facility\",\"general\",\"appreciate\",\"learn\",\"enjoy\",\"human\",\"group\",\"protocol\",\"hand\",\"arrive\",\"using\",\"maine\",\"family\",\"book\",\"attention\",\"comply\",\"previou\",\"year\",\"problem\",\"provide\",\"prevent\",\"male\",\"shown\",\"hope\",\"used\",\"time\",\"people\"],\"no_of_keys\":258}', '2019-02-06 05:32:48');

The museum also intends to showcase more women than it has ever before.\r\n\r\nAccording to The New York Times, which broke the story, the museum will end the discipline-based display system it has used for decades to separate painting, sculpture, architecture, design, photography, performance, film, paper, and mixed media from each other. There will also be a new two-story studio for live and experimental programming, including performance, dance, music, moving image, and sound.\r\n\r\nDesigned by Diller Scofidio + Renfro in collaboration with Gensler, the MoMA renovation includes space built upon the demolished remains of the American Folk Art Museum. Existing galleries will also expand west through 53W53, the luxury residential skyscraper designed by Jean Nouvel.\r\nNorth/south section-perspective through the new gallery spaces at The Museum of Modern Art, looking east along Fifty-third Street (courtesy MoMA, Â© 2017 Diller Scofidio + Renfro)\r\n\r\nâ€œA new generation of curators is discovering the richness of what is in our collection, and there is great work being made around the world that we need to pay attention to,â€ Glenn D. Lowry, director of the museum, told The New York Times. â€œIt means that the usual gets supplanted now by the unexpected.â€\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the theme of MoMaâ€™s massive rehang seems to be a reexamination of the permanent collection. Curators will rotate the selection of art in the galleries every six to nine months and the opening exhibitions will also draw from the museumâ€™s holdings.\r\n\r\nRest assured, cornerstones of the collection will still have a prominent position in the galleries, but alongside mainstays like Picasso and Van Gogh will be less familiar names like Okwui Okpokwasili, an Igbo-Nigerian-American artist, performer, and choreographer. Accordingly, the museum will reopen with a survey of Latin American art, along with exhibitions by two prominent African-American artists, Pope L. and Betye Saar.\r\n\r\nToday, MoMA also announced a multi-year partnership between itself, the Studio Museum in Harlem, and MoMA PS1. The first in a series of collaborative programs will be an exhibition of new work by current participants in the Studio Museums artist-in-residence program, which opens at MoMA PS1 on June 9. The show will feature works by Allison Janae Hamilton, Tschabalala Self, and Sable Elyse Smith.

(83, 14, 'Asylum Seeker Wins Literary Prize for Book Written via WhatsApp', 'On Thursday, Iranian-Kurdish writer and asylum seeker Behrouz Boochani won Australiaâ€™s highest-paying literary prize for a book he wrote through WhatsApp texts while being held in a detention center in Papua New Guinea for five years.\r\n\r\nCalled No Friend but the Mountains: Writing from Manus Prison, the book was awarded the 2019 Victorian Prize for Literature, which grants the winning author 125,000 Australian dollars (~$90,000). Unlike previous winners, who include some of Australiaâ€™s most prominent writers, Boochani could not attend the ceremony to accept his award, as he remains in detention.\r\n\r\nBoochani fled his home country of Iran in 2013 after the police there raided his office and arrested several of his journalist friends. He tried to reach Australia by boat, but the countryâ€™s Navy intercepted him and sent him to an offshore detention center on Manus Island, Papua New Guinea, where heâ€™s been held ever since.\r\n\r\nBoochani is among 600 refugees who remain in the islandâ€™s notoriously harsh camps despite Australia having closed its â€œregional processing centerâ€ in 2017. Under Australiaâ€™s migration policy, asylum seekers arriving by sea are barred from entering the country; detainees at offshore processing centers are told theyâ€™ll never settle on the mainland.\r\n\r\nShortly after arriving on Manus, Boochani began chronicling his experiences by typing notes on his cell phone. He sent passages of his writings via WhatsApp texts in Farsi to his translator, Omid Tofighian. These piecemeal texts were eventually stitched together into a 416-page autobiographical account of the horrors of imprisonment in what human rights activists have dubbed â€œAustraliaâ€™s Guantanamo.â€\r\n\r\nThe award committee referred to the book as a â€œvoice of witness, an act of survival. A lyric first-hand account. A cry of resistance. A vivid portrait through five years of incarceration and exile.â€\r\n\r\nThe judgesâ€™ report read, in part:\r\n\r\n    Boochani has produced a stunning work of art and critical theory which evades simple description. At its heart, though, it is a detailed critical study and description of what Boochani terms â€˜Manus Prison Theoryâ€™â€¦ [He] provides a new understanding both of Australiaâ€™s actions and of Australia itself. Distinctive narrative formations are used, from critical analysis to thick description to poetry to dystopian surrealism. The writing is beautiful and precise, blending literary traditions emanating from across the world, but particularly from within Kurdish practices.\r\n\r\nBoochani, 35, recorded an acceptance speech for awards ceremony attendees. â€œWith humility, I would like to say that this award is a victory. It is a victory not only for us, but for literature and art and above all, it is a victory for humanity,â€ he said in the speech. â€œA victory against a system that has never recognized us as human beings.

(84, 14, 'A Retrospective at a Rapidly Growing Startup', 'Liberating Structures are 33 easy-to-apply structures for interaction in groups of any size. They enhance relational coordination and trust, foster lively participation and give everyone the opportunity to work at the top of their intelligence. What\'s more, you can easily create strings of Liberating Structures to achieve some greater purpose. In this post, we share the strings we use.\r\nDesigning Strings of Liberating Structures\r\n\r\n    \"Learning Liberating Structures is like learning a new language. First you learn individual words. Then you put them together into a simple sentence and soon you are speaking series of sentences in the new language.\"\r\n\r\n    â€” Henri Lipmanowicz and Keith McCandless \r\n\r\nLiberating Structures become progressively powerful when you combine them into \"strings\", where groups flow naturally from one structure into the next. Designing a string of Liberating Structures increases the desired impact for the challenge at hand. In this series, we\'ll share the strings we\'ve used and what they made possible within our Scrum engagements. We hope that this inspires you to try designing your own strings and apply them during your Scrum events.\r\nThe Situation\r\n\r\nWe recently facilitated a Retrospective at a rapidly growing startup that is facing challenges related to that growth. They need to evolve their current way of working and collaboration to allow the number of people working on the product to scale up. In order to make way for a coming period of training and coaching, we asked the team if we could facilitate a 2-hour Retrospective to get a sense of their challenges. Although the team uses Scrum with weekly Sprints, the past few weeks had been quite chaotic. The most recent Sprint Retrospective was several months ago. The team also expressed a desire to ask us questions about our experiences with similar teams.\r\nPurpose\r\n\r\nBefore designing a string, we clarified the goals we wanted to achieve:\r\n\r\n    Get a sense of the challenges that the team sees, and evidence there is to support this;\r\n    Identify small improvements that the team can already start making;\r\n    Build trust between us and the team and between people in the team;\r\n    Give the opportunity to answer some questions from the team;\r\n\r\nDesign of the String\r\n\r\nWe ended up with the following design for a 120-minute Retrospective:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Start with Impromptu Networking (15 min) to get a sense of immediate challenges perceived by the team, and to set the tone for the level of interaction for the remainder of the Retrospective. We used the following invitation: \"What challenges do you bring to this gathering? What do you hope to get from and give this group?\";\r\n    Use What, So What, Now What (40 min) to reflect on the period since the previous Sprint Retrospective. What did the team observe, factually? What does that mean to them? What actions make sense based on those conclusions? We chose W3 to avoid jumping to conclusions too quickly. We used the following invitations for the three rounds (each with a 1-4-ALL pattern):\r\n        Round 1: \"What have you seen, heard or observed since the previous Retrospective? What stood out for you?\";\r\n        Round 2: \"Why is that important? What patterns or conclusions are emerging?\";\r\n        Round 3: \"Now what? What actions make sense?\";\r\n    Follow up with a Celebrity Interview (30 min) where the team generates questions for us (as \"experts\") to answer, based on the challenges they identified before;\r\n    Use 15% Solutions to identify individual, small improvements that the team can get started with right away, and create the opportunity for people to give and get help in working on their solutions. We used the following invitation: \"What is your personal 15% Solution for the coming period? Something you do not need any additional resources, permission, or authority to do right now?\";\r\n    We kept 1-2-4-ALL in our back pocket as an \"adjacent possibility\" for when the individual focus of 15% Solutions wouldn\'t fit with the challenges identified;\r\n\r\nTo design the string, we made good use of the Liberating Structures cards from Holisticon.

Rather than a couple of people doing the most of the talking, everyone had the opportunity to share observations, insights, and ideas.\r\n\r\nThe team discovered that it was easy to jump to conclusions, without first clarifying what led to those conclusions. This proved very important for abstract concepts like \"personal responsibility\" and \"team morale.\" Consistently, but gently asking, \"How did you notice [X]?\" helped the team clarify what behaviors and observations supported (or falsified) conclusions.\r\n\r\nDefining 15% Solutions helped the team work from their personal responsibility to what they could improve as a team. Rather than ending up with some abstract things to improve \"as a team\", they ended up with individual improvements instead (not something to do every time, but it felt like a useful variation).\r\n\r\nBased on our experiences with this string, we learned:\r\n\r\n    The group struggled with the invitation to Impromptu Networking. Not having any prior experience with LS, the team had some difficulty understanding this \"specifically ambiguous\" question and relating it to their context. A simpler invitation would\'ve worked better;\r\n    We decided in-the-moment to switch 15% Solutions and the Celebrity Interview. This felt more natural considering the conversation that the team was having about \"personal responsibility\" at the end of W3;\r\n    During the structures, we used sticky notes to keep the invitations visible. We also invited people to write down their thoughts on stickies and present them as a group (e.g. as part of 1-4-ALL);\r\n\r\nClosing\r\n\r\nIn this blog post, we\'ve shared the string of Liberating Structures used at a Retrospective for a rapidly growing startup. Our intention was to get a sense of the challenges that the team sees, identify small improvements that the team can already start making, build trust between us and the team and between people in the team and give the opportunity to answer some questions from the team. The selected Liberating Structures helped us achieve this purpose.\r\n\r\nIf you\'d like to experience Liberating Structures first-hand, make sure to join our Dutch user group or check the ones in your area.', '[\"team\",\"trust\",\"retrospective\",\"challenge\"]', 1, '{\"keys\":[\"team\",\"apply\",\"string\",\"sense\",\"trust\",\"retrospective\",\"liberating\",\"structure\",\"challenge\",\"answer\",\"conclusion\",\"facilitate\",\"invitation\",\"flow\",\"identify\",\"hour\",\"question\",\"create\",\"post\",\"share\",\"individual\",\"following\",\"round\",\"expert\",\"responsibility\",\"growing\",\"group\",\"work\",\"rapid\",\"startup\",\"achieve\",\"sentence\",\"scrum\",\"improve\",\"easy\",\"improvement\",\"personal\",\"start\",\"learn\",\"working\",\"sprint\",\"participation\",\"intelligence\",\"learning\",\"language\",\"coming\",\"clarify\",\"se\",\"evidence\",\"ended\",\"impromptu\",\"networking\",\"important\",\"celebrity\",\"holisticon\",\"morale\",\"idea\",\"abstract\",\"felt\",\"sticky\",\"opportunity\",\"based\",\"interaction\",\"sery\",\"natural\",\"relate\",\"support\",\"immediate\",\"conversation\",\"like\",\"recent\",\"people\",\"possibility\",\"making\",\"action\",\"away\",\"enhance\",\"relational\",\"coordination\",\"foster\",\"lively\",\"soon\",\"speaking\",\"henri\",\"lipmanowicz\",\"keith\",\"mccand\",\"progressive\",\"inspire\",\"evolve\",\"product\",\"training\",\"coaching\",\"asked\",\"chaotic\",\"expres\",\"goal\",\"remainder\",\"gathering\",\"reflect\",\"factual\",\"chose\",\"avoid\",\"heard\",\"observ\",\"stood\",\"emerging\",\"generate\",\"permission\",\"pocket\",\"adjacent\",\"wouldn\",\"netherland\",\"message\",\"distribute\",\"deck\",\"germany\",\"outcome\",\"came\",\"excellent\",\"element\",\"functioning\",\"talking\",\"insight\",\"clarifying\",\"consistent\",\"gently\",\"asking\",\"falsify\",\"defining\",\"struggl\",\"ambiguou\",\"relating\",\"context\",\"simpler\",\"decide\",\"switch\",\"considering\",\"visibility\",\"invite\",\"write\",\"blog\",\"select\",\"sure\",\"join\",\"dutch\",\"user\",\"one\",\"hand\",\"order\",\"previou\",\"having\",\"greater\",\"impact\",\"event\",\"facing\",\"allow\",\"scale\",\"weekly\",\"week\",\"perceive\",\"level\",\"seen\",\"authority\",\"focu\",\"free\",\"enjoye\",\"couple\",\"instead\",\"variation\",\"prior\",\"difficulty\",\"specifical\",\"area\",\"doe\",\"used\",\"power\",\"collaboration\",\"number\",\"quite\",\"month\",\"additional\",\"resource\",\"kept\",\"doing\",\"discovere\",\"concept\",\"behavior\",\"thing\",\"size\",\"understanding\",\"present\"],\"no_of_keys\":192}', '2019-02-06 05:40:55'),

It lays out a path to success based on a statistical analysis of data. It also puts an end to the popular narrative that \"becoming Agile\" is somehow a fuzzy process. The data shows that there are patterns at all levels that successful Agile organizations share.\r\n\r\nIn other words: becoming Agile can be data-driven, (a hypothesis that I shared in \"How to Measure Agility of Organizations and Teams â€” The Results of the Agile Maturity Survey\" earlier).\r\nAccelerate: How To Drive Improvement\r\n\r\nSince 2014, Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim have been publishing the \"State of DevOps Report.\" The report is a well-respected survey to help to understand how DevOps as a set of practices and cultural value supports companies improving software engineering and release practices, software quality, information security, and generally receiving feedback on product development.

(86, 14, 'Accept the Change', 'Change is inevitable and constant; it is a part of our lives. Sooner or later, we have to accept the change. 13 years ago, I joined a small IT organization of around 100 people, as a developer. I have grown with the organization, a journey that has seen it grow to 40 times its original size. I really thank the organization for giving me the opportunity and transforming me into what I am today. Now, the time has come to accept a change, and start a new journey. I am writing this post to share my point of view about when to accept the change.\r\nWhen to Change the Organization?\r\n\r\nThe intention behind this post is not to answer this question, but to address what you get and what you lose when you stay too long in the same organization. I have also taken inputs from many senior folks who joined us or left us after a long stay. When to change is really an individual\'s choice. If you are aware of the pros and cons of staying at a company for a long time, then you may probably work on the cons and stay relevant even longer, or don\'t change at all.\r\nWhat Do You Get?\r\n\r\nWhen you join a small software organization and stay for a while, say more than 10 years, and grow with the organization\'s pace, these are some factors which may keep you attached to the same organization:\r\nYou Are Tried and Tested\r\n\r\nYou become a tried and tested resource of the organization; many stakeholders may want to take you in their group. You don\'t need to constantly prove yourself to get into an opportunity in the organization.\r\nYou Know the Beats\r\n\r\nEvery organization grows in its own style and nurtures its own culture. You know the beats of the organization, you know how things are done in a certain way, you know the history. In time, you become a consultant for many things in the organization. People believe in your inputs, and you become an encyclopedia of organizational information. Since you have participated in almost everything, you see yourself in every part of an organization, be it hiring, training, process or the system.\r\nBreadth and Depth\r\n\r\nYou may get a chance to work in different departments and a chance to set up groups and lead multiple initiatives. This gives you a chance to gain the breadth and depth, and a rich experience to lead the organization.\r\nAttractive Role and Appreciations\r\n\r\nYou may be working on really attracting talent at for a subordinate role with less experience in terms of years. You may be recognized and appreciated well.\r\nEmotional Connect\r\n\r\nAfter many years, your relationship with the organization is no longer just professional, it becomes an emotional one. The organization becomes a family, and you will have a lot of friends.\r\nComfort Zone\r\n\r\nYou are in your comfort zone and can work very confidently in the same zone.\r\nStability\r\n\r\nThe industry may see you as a stable resource that doesn\'t change too often.\r\nWhat Do You Lose?\r\n\r\nStaying too long will accumulate following, and you may keep building on top of these unknowingly. You may work to overcome these and stay prepared to go even longer on the journey.\r\nLack of Diversity\r\n\r\nSince you have worked in the same organization for such a long period, you start thinking that certain things can happen only in a certain way. These certain things could be dealing with processes, people, resources, and even technology solutions. You know them well, which worked well and which did not for you in that organization. Thinking beyond your area of easy imagination does not come easily. It may start blocking your path and in time may become frustrating.\r\nResistant to The Change\r\n\r\nAfter staying so long, you become resistant to the change in the processes, people and the system. It becomes hard to accept the change, if that is not according to you.\r\nWorking Out of Your Comfort Zone Becomes Difficult\r\n\r\nIt becomes difficult to work beyond your comfort zone, and you may start running away from situations which take you out of your comfort zone. Risk-taking capabilities may also be reduced, as you worked in a really safe and secure zone for long. You may not have learned to deal with the failures, and have not been exploited and exposed well since long. We learn well when we get exposed from time to time.\r\nYou Are Taken for Granted\r\n\r\nYou may be taken for granted by your peers of similar experience and by management; they know all of your flaws, as you have grown in front of them. They may use you the way they want and wherever they want. It will be hard to change the perception of people around you. You may also be a target for the newcomers, as they don\'t really know the history and achievements that you might have.\r\nEnergy and Satisfaction\r\n\r\nAfter so many years, you may not have the energy to fight against changes, which may kill the culture you are addicted to. Remember that change is necessary, to scale the organization, and to sustain and to go beyond the barriers, but you might not be aligned with the changes. You may not be satisfied with the situations and with what you get. In such a situation, you start creating a negative environment, which is not good for both you and your organization.\r\nConfidence in Industry\r\n\r\nAs the years progress, jobs become limited at your level. The market outside may not be ready to accept you, in the way you are, and you will need to adapt. If you stay up-to-date and refresh your skills from time to time, you gain a lot of confidence, and that can help in your current job as well.\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nI have shared the pros and cons of a long stay in the same IT organization; it may help you in identifying the losses you are accumulating year by year after certain years. You may plan to overcome the losses and stay useful to the same organization you are in, or take the next step.', '[\"organization\",\"share\",\"live\",\"change\"]', 1, '{\"keys\":[\"organization\",\"share\",\"live\",\"change\",\"longer\",\"stay\",\"zone\",\"post\",\"con\",\"comfort\",\"try\",\"certain\",\"want\",\"journey\",\"grow\",\"taken\",\"pro\",\"staying\",\"rich\",\"role\",\"opportunity\",\"really\",\"accept\",\"grant\",\"working\",\"point\",\"resource\",\"thing\",\"just\",\"hard\",\"constant\",\"grown\",\"answer\",\"lose\",\"input\",\"join\",\"pace\",\"beat\",\"nurture\",\"culture\",\"breadth\",\"depth\",\"lead\",\"attractive\",\"emotional\",\"stability\",\"industry\",\"overcome\",\"thinking\",\"resistant\",\"expose\",\"confidence\",\"loss\",\"start\",\"joine\",\"small\",\"come\",\"folk\",\"gain\",\"prepare\",\"group\",\"history\",\"away\",\"energy\",\"help\",\"developer\",\"giving\",\"transforming\",\"intention\",\"left\",\"individual\",\"choice\",\"aware\",\"company\",\"relevant\",\"software\",\"attach\",\"stakeholder\",\"style\",\"consultant\",\"encyclopedia\",\"organizational\",\"information\",\"participate\",\"hiring\",\"training\",\"different\",\"multiple\",\"initiative\",\"appreciation\",\"attracting\",\"talent\",\"subordinate\",\"accumulate\",\"following\",\"building\",\"unknowing\",\"dealing\",\"path\",\"frustrating\",\"capability\",\"failure\",\"exploite\",\"similar\",\"management\",\"flaw\",\"perception\",\"newcomer\",\"achievement\",\"satisfaction\",\"fight\",\"kill\",\"addict\",\"remember\",\"align\",\"satisfy\",\"negative\",\"environment\",\"market\",\"adapt\",\"date\",\"refresh\",\"skill\",\"conclusion\",\"identifying\",\"accumulating\",\"plan\",\"time\",\"inevitability\",\"sooner\",\"later\",\"seen\",\"original\",\"thank\",\"today\",\"writing\",\"view\",\"question\",\"senior\",\"probab\",\"department\",\"appreciate\",\"relationship\",\"confident\",\"doesn\",\"technology\",\"area\",\"blocking\",\"reduce\",\"peer\",\"necessary\",\"scale\",\"barrier\",\"creating\",\"progress\",\"believe\",\"friend\",\"diversity\",\"according\",\"limite\",\"year\",\"size\",\"factor\",\"doe\",\"term\"],\"no_of_keys\":165}', '2019-02-06 05:42:17');

(87, 14, 'Agile Principles in Action', 'I recently wrote about the Agile Values and what they mean to me.  So many people I run into think just using a set of specific practices will make their teams Agile â€“ wrong.  Over the years Iâ€™ve come to realize that Agile is mostly a mindset â€“ a way of thinking differently about software development.  Incorporating sprints, user stories, daily stand-ups, and other process-related practices can still lead to failure â€“ unless we also change the way we think.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of Agile â€“ the Agile Manifestoâ€™s four values and twelve principles â€“ can sometimes mask the challenge of learning to think and behave differently.  A culture of agility means embracing ideas that many of us are uncomfortable with, or even fear. \r\n\r\nHereâ€™s what the Agile Principles mean to me.\r\n\r\nOur highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. Some of us in IT have forgotten that the primary goal of software development is the development and delivery of software; the end goal is not documentation or project plans. Agile development doesnâ€™t force our customers to wait months before software can be seen â€“ we show working software after every sprint â€“ often every two weeks. Then, two weeks later, more working software is delivered. Continuous delivery of software allows for quicker feedback from stakeholders, which gives better visibility into the development process, and results in software that is more satisfying to our customers.\r\n\r\nThe last part of this principle states â€œâ€¦delivery of valuable software.â€ One of the keys to Agile success is that we are always working on what the Product Owner considers the highest value features. Business value is determined through stakeholder collaboration, and then the Product Backlog is groomed/refined, prioritized and ranked so the team always knows what is most important. This loop of delivering software, obtaining quick feedback, refining the backlog, then repeating the process helps us deliver high value quickly and continuously.\r\n\r\nWelcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer\'s competitive advantage. A reality of most software development is that requirements change â€“ sometimes often. Market conditions change, technologies change, stakeholders change their minds or come up with better ideasâ€¦the list goes on and on for why requirements may change. Traditional software development often takes a change management approach to reduce scope creep, which can result in â€œchange prevention.â€ Agile development welcomes change and treats changes equally â€“ putting changes into the Product Backlog where they are prioritized and ranked among the other user stories. Late arriving, high priority requirements that are quickly developed and deployed to production could potentially deliver a competitive edge â€“ why wouldnâ€™t we want to incorporate these better ideas into our software?\r\n\r\nDeliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to a shorter timescale. Frequent delivery of working software allows stakeholders to see their user stories come to life and offers short feedback cycles. These short iterations of delivery and feedback help ensure that what is being developed is truly what stakeholders want. Frequent software delivery also provides high visibility and transparency into the project, because everyone sees what has or has not been developed to date. Finally, short delivery and feedback cycles reduce project risk because stakeholders can change direction more quickly if a feature is deemed unnecessary, or a feature with higher value is discovered. The days of development teams being handed requirements and going away for six months before showing working code are over â€“ at least in an Agile environment.\r\n\r\nBusiness people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. A key to Agile development success is active stakeholder participation. When we interact with someone daily, we form a better relationship with them, we understand each other better, we tend to ask more questions, and we make decisions that are more mutually beneficial. Frequent interaction with someone helps ensure weâ€™re continually on their mind â€“ weâ€™re on their front burner, not their back burner. The greater the physical distance, or the greater the time between contact with someone, the less likely we are to engage with them.\r\n\r\nRisk increases whenever we develop something or make a decision solely on our own. Agile reduces risk by providing frequent opportunities for people to collaborate and challenge each other. Agile development is successful in large part when developers and business people are constantly discussing and understanding needs, and then delivering valuable software that meets those needs.\r\n\r\nBuild projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. Another key to Agile success is having teams of skilled professionals who care about the product theyâ€™re developing, and who are willing to learn from each other. They have the humility to respect each other and ask questions, and realize that people are a primary success factor in software development. They take pride in the quality of their work, refuse to be blocked, and give their best effort. Motivated, skilled teams donâ€™t need babysitting, and management doesnâ€™t need to spend time coaxing them to perform. They perform because they are professionals who were given a clear vision of where to go, they were given the right tools to get the job done, and they were given the trust and freedom to succeed.\r\n\r\nThe most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. When it comes to effective communication, nothing beats a face-to-face conversation. Face-to-face discussion shortens the time between a question and its answer, and helps avoid miscommunication. When we communicate via email, instant messaging or even phone, we canâ€™t see the recipientsâ€™ facial expressions or body language â€“ we donâ€™t see their eyes roll, or see them crossing their arms in a defensive posture. Agile teams often sit together to make it easier to ask questions and offer suggestions. When we need to talk about something, weâ€™re right there â€“ together, and we tend to go ahead and ask instead of putting it off, or forgetting about it, or diluting the message with an email. Each time you consider emailing someone who sits near you â€“ STOP.  Instead, go have a face-to-face conversation. Over the course of weeks or months, youâ€™ll be amazed at the time savings and how much more effective your communications are.\r\n\r\nWorking software is the primary measure of progress. There is no better way to measure development progress than by showing working, quality software that provides value to the customer. Producing status reports, Gantt charts, flow diagrams, and other artifacts are all secondary (and in some cases irrelevant) compared to producing working software that we show to our stakeholders. Software thatâ€™s almost done (still not working), or completely done except for ______ (fill in the blank with your favorite excuse) is not truly â€œdone-doneâ€. The only accurate measure of development progress is working software.\r\n\r\nAgile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. Long-term agility requires motivated people that deliver high-quality work, and continually improve how they do things. The longer we work together as teams, the better we come to understand our potential and our limitations. Retrospection helps us continually improve our processes and practices, and helps us become more efficient and higher performing. This better understanding of ourselves and our teams, and these continual improvements tend to help us increase our sprint-to-sprint velocity over timeâ€¦to a point. We want to eventually reach a point where we are delivering our commitments consistently, we are delivering high-quality results, and weâ€™re not killing ourselves in the process. Yes, there are occasions when we need to put in the extra time to get that last user story to â€œdone-doneâ€, but working extended hours shouldnâ€™t be the norm. Excessively long hours for weeks or months at a time takes a toll on us, and often results in lower quality output and less motivated teams. Reaching and maintaining a good, sustainable pace promotes healthier team dynamics, higher quality code, and higher quality of life for us as team members.\r\n\r\nContinuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. We all want to be proud of our code and the products we develop. Common myths about Agile development are that it is â€œcowboy codingâ€ â€“ shooting from the hip, it has little or no planning, it delivers fast but without regard for quality. Nothing could be further from the truth! The Agile values and principles promote effective planning and high quality that starts with good design and technical excellence. It\'s much easier to understand and maintain high-quality code than it is to work with poorly designed, poorly written code. Start with agreed-upon coding standards, adopt tools and processes that will foster good design/development such as Test-Driven Development, pair programming, frequent refactoring, continuous integration and collective code ownership.\r\n\r\nEnsure that your product gets better with each iteration by writing code that you are proud of in every detail.  Technical excellence is the responsibility of the entire team. Cultivate in yourself an attitude of life-long learning to acquire new knowledge and improve your skills, then apply that knowledge to your design and code delivery.\r\n\r\nSimplicity â€“ the art of maximizing the amount of work not done â€“ is essential. Agile started out as a very simple concept. The authors of the Agile Manifesto came up with 4 values and 12 supporting Agile principles. Similarly, Scrum has a few roles, artifacts and ceremonies. The wealth of other Agile information youâ€™ll find out there is an attempt to improve on the Agile philosophy. Some of those ideas are great additions and some just complicate the simple concept of Agile.\r\n\r\nAgile teams focus on high-value activities.  We endeavor to maximize our stakeholder\'s return on investment. This mindset is not just about productivity; itâ€™s also about simplicity â€“ about â€œmaximizing the amount of work not done.â€ We avoid doing things that don\'t matter, and we either simplify or automate mundane effort wherever we can. We determine what really needs to get done, and we remove non-value-adding activities. One example of maximizing the amount of work not done is the Lean UX technique â€œFeature Fakeâ€. For example, to quickly test the viability of a potential feature without spending a lot of time and money, put a link or button for the feature on a page, that, when clicked, displays â€œThis feature may be available soonâ€¦how likely would you be to use it? â€“ Unlikely, Maybe, Likelyâ€. Leave it there for a few days, then use the insights gathered to determine if you should build it.\r\n\r\nAgile Developers also create a simple design. Having to reverse-engineer someone elseâ€™s code can be a complicated effort. Complexity hinders passion and slows progress. Keep it simple, focus on high-value activities and maximize the amount of work not done.\r\n\r\nThe best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. But what does â€œself-organizingâ€ really mean? Does it mean that Agile teams are totally autonomous and can do whatever they want? No; itâ€™s a mindset or team trait â€“ an attitude of figuring things out, creating appropriate approaches and adapting to meet the challenges that arise in their environment. Management and other leaders associated with an Agile team help create an environment that fosters self-organizing teams, but they avoid controlling team behavior. In â€œThe New-New Product Development Gameâ€, Takeuchi and Nonaka write that â€œsubtle control is also consistent with the self-organizing character of project teams.â€ Mike Cohn adds, â€œSelf-organizing is about the team determining how they will respond to their environment (and managers can influence that environment)â€.\r\n\r\nAgile teams don\'t wait around to be told what to do, or who does what. An Agile teamâ€™s job is to continually self-organize around the challenges, and within the boundaries and constraints put in place by management. Esther Derby states, â€œThereâ€™s a reason we use the term â€˜self-organizingâ€™ rather than â€˜self-organizedâ€™ or â€˜self-managedâ€™. Thatâ€™s because itâ€™s a process and a characteristic, not something that is done once and for all.â€ Mature, long-standing Agile teams may evolve to the point when they themselves have more influence over their environment due to proven success, but there will always be constraints to work within. Great Agile teams use their self-organizing characteristic to adapt to constraints and challenges within their environment to deliver and perform well, and then continue to improve.\r\n\r\nAt regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. A pillar of the Agile mindset is inspection and adaptation. This applies not only to the software weâ€™re developing, but also to how we go about developing that software and work as a team. The Sprint Retrospective is one way we inspect and adapt. Each sprint, we look for ways to improve processes, simplify how we do things, increase code quality, work better together and improve the predictability of our results. We bring up issues and look for root causes and their solutions, and we celebrate what went well so we donâ€™t lose sight of what has helped us succeed.  Too often, though, a team will suspend conducting a Retrospective due to time constraints; similar to why we often forego software documentation â€“ it is seen as a low priority compared to moving on to the next big thing.  However, you can only have continual improvement when you pause to reflect on whatâ€™s working or not working, then make a conscious decision to adjust things. Little tweaks here and there can make the difference between success and failure.\r\n\r\nEven the highest performing teams will find ways to improve. Every Super Bowl and World Cup winning team watches the game tape after theyâ€™ve won the championship to find areas to improve next season. Action without reflection leads to burnout, and reflection without action leads to cynicism. Conduct a Retrospective after every sprint, and then actually implement the valuable changes that come out of it. Agile is all about continual improvement, and with regular Retrospectives, improvement is never very far away.\r\n\r\nSo, in summary, even though the practices of Scrum, Kanban, and other Agile frameworks are important, practices alone can still lead to failure.

(88, 14, 'Are Standing Meetings Scuppered By Social Awkwardness', 'Meetings are one of the most frustrating aspects of modern working life, with few of us enjoying them, yet most of us suffering a growing number during a typical day. Some believe that standing during the meeting renders them more productive as being upright gives them a sense of urgency that is often lacking.\r\n\r\nAlas, recent research from King\'s College London and Brunel University London suggests that participants struggle during such meetings as standing appears to break the social rules of the meeting.\r\n\r\nStanding meetings have a number of advocates, not only because they believe they make meetings more productive, but they also break up the sedentary lifestyle of the typical office worker. Indeed, concern over prolonged sitting is growing, with research linking it to a range of health issues.\r\n\r\n\"Sedentary office work is an urgent public health issue,\" the authors say. \"For some employers, such as software developers, standing meetings are commonplace. We need to get to the point where standing is the new normal for workers who would rather not be sat down.\"\r\nHealthier Meetings\r\n\r\nThe researchers explored the rather unnatural-seeming scenario of meetings whereby some participants are standing, and some seated to try and identify barriers to getting people on their feet. Participants were asked to stand in three different meetings, until it no longer felt appropriate to do so.\r\n\r\n\"We found that standing in meetings is a social minefield. Our participants often felt awkward about standing â€” they felt more visible to others, and worried that other attendees would think they were \'attention seekers\',\" the authors say.\r\n\r\nParticipants reported a range of emotions, from awkward to stupid, and reported feeling like they were breaking various unwritten rules of the meeting. This was particularly so informal meetings or when addressing sensitive topics. This forced many standing participants to retreat to the margins of the room, and therefore of the meeting itself.\r\nNot All Bad\r\n\r\nSuffice to say, not all of the experiences were negative, with some participants revealing that they felt more engaged in the meeting, and by standing, they were motivated to keep the meeting short.\r\n\r\nWhat\'s more, participants felt empowered when they themselves were chairing the meetings, and they felt better able to stand and retain authority. They were, however, concerned that this could be interpreted as an inappropriate assertion of power, especially if they had a high level of seniority in the organization.\r\n\r\n\"Ours is the first study to find out how people actually experience standing up in meetings,\" the authors explain. \"Initial experiences of new behaviors can determine whether people will keep going. While standing is not a one-size-fits-all solution, it\'s about creating activity permissive cultures at work where people have the opportunity to move around more.\"\r\n\r\nSuffice to say, if organizations do adopt standing meetings, it might be realistic to expect them to be all or nothing rather than a mixture of standing and seated, but if things are more free-form, then these findings can be illustrative of the challenges they may face. In such circumstances, the researchers advocate some rules to overcome any awkwardness, such as mandating people stand if they wish to speak in the meeting. Alternatively, they could equip meeting areas with high tables and stools.\r\n\r\nWhatever strategy you deploy, take an experimental approach and make sure you get feedback from employees regarding how they feel.', '[\"meeting\"]', 1, '{\"keys\":[\"meeting\",\"standing\",\"render\",\"sense\",\"felt\",\"participant\",\"king\",\"typical\",\"concern\",\"stand\",\"author\",\"appropriate\",\"number\",\"awkwardness\",\"aspect\",\"productive\",\"london\",\"sedentary\",\"worker\",\"range\",\"seate\",\"awkward\",\"suffice\",\"social\",\"believe\",\"research\",\"work\",\"growing\",\"advocate\",\"engage\",\"organization\",\"modern\",\"point\",\"particular\",\"scuppere\",\"frustrating\",\"enjoying\",\"suffering\",\"urgency\",\"lacking\",\"ala\",\"brunel\",\"suggest\",\"struggle\",\"lifestyle\",\"prolong\",\"sitting\",\"linking\",\"issu\",\"urgent\",\"employer\",\"software\",\"developer\",\"commonplace\",\"unnatural\",\"identify\",\"getting\",\"asked\",\"different\",\"minefield\",\"visibility\",\"stupid\",\"breaking\",\"unwritten\",\"informal\",\"addressing\",\"sensitive\",\"retreat\",\"margin\",\"room\",\"negative\",\"revealing\",\"motivate\",\"short\",\"empowere\",\"chairing\",\"interprete\",\"inappropriate\",\"assertion\",\"seniority\",\"permissive\",\"culture\",\"realistic\",\"mixture\",\"finding\",\"illustrative\",\"challenge\",\"circumstance\",\"overcome\",\"mandating\",\"speak\",\"alternative\",\"equip\",\"table\",\"stool\",\"strategy\",\"deploy\",\"sure\",\"feedback\",\"employee\",\"regarding\",\"researcher\",\"high\",\"people\",\"working\",\"college\",\"university\",\"appear\",\"public\",\"need\",\"scenario\",\"barrier\",\"longer\",\"attendee\",\"seeker\",\"emotion\",\"forc\",\"explain\",\"initial\",\"determine\",\"going\",\"solution\",\"creating\",\"activity\",\"adopt\",\"expect\",\"free\",\"area\",\"approach\",\"health\",\"life\",\"actual\",\"behavior\",\"thing\",\"experimental\",\"like\",\"feet\",\"attention\",\"variou\",\"size\",\"opportunity\"],\"no_of_keys\":141}', '2019-02-06 05:44:20');
